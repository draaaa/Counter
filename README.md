a stupid class joke turned into a personal project for myself in pursuit of learning more about python
in particular, the os module and the integrated ui, tkinter

essentially, the code records the number of times you hit a key (internally known as "startkey") as well as the time
when the key to end (internally known as "endkey") the code is struck, it will show you the results, as well as prompt for if you wanted to save the data
if saved, it will create a folder in your user directory and save txt files with 3 lines of text, being the number of times the counting hotkey ("startkey") is hit,
amount of time between the beginning of the interval and the ending hotkey ("endkey"),
and the average of the number of times the counting hotkey ("startkey") has been hit per minute respectively.
the end label on tkinter will also display the data in the same order.
